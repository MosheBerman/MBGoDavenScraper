This repository is for a utility that scrapes data from GoDaven.com. It was a little experiment of mine, which works suprisingly well. :-D

You may use this code for whatever you want, so long as you don't sell it or use it for anything in violation of Federal law in the USA and in your legal jurisdiction. (Yea, scraping data is generally frowned upon.)
